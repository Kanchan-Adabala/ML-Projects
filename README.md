# ML-Projects
## Introduction:
This repository contains all the projects developed by me as a part of my academic study and for self learning purposes. I have used python for the tasks.

## Contents:
[Cancer Mortality rate](https://github.com/Kanchan-Adabala/ML-Projects/blob/main/Cancer%20mortality%20rate_prediction.ipynb)
The cancer mortality rates are predicted in US for different counties. The task is for the unseen counties, the mortality rate should be predicted. For this, the regression tasks are used along with a random Forest Regressor to find out which model works best for the data.

Tools used: Python, sklearn, matplotlib,numpy
